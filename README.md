Alessio managed the most advanced techy stuff, knows the greater view of the website, created most of the components and made them communicate harmonically, and is definitely too committed at extensively committing every little fix all around the website. He only worked on the master branch(!) and managed the merging of other branches into master. Mousa filled and maintained the db with real data, created homepage concept, contact page and form component, and all the chatbot design, model, implementation and documentation in branch ChatBot (and lately in master). Dorotea created the DB structure and APIs, footer concept and footer component, about-company and about-people and about-person pages, developed an intro component later discontinued in favour of the more general `<item-intro>`.
